# Introduction
- A programming style. Cpp supports multiple styles 1. Functional 2. Object Oriented
- Think of it as bank forms. One original structure/blueprint (class) of form with empty/variable fields is made and then each customer is handed a copy(instance) of that original class, in which they can add their unique data. Every instance is seperate from one-another.

# Class
- Attributes
    - all the variables declared inside a class.
- Methods
    - all the functions declared and defined inside a class.

# Objects
- access the attributes and methods using '.' notation.

# Constructor
- whenever object is made constructor is called automatically.
- doesn't take any datatype specification during declaration.
- uses exact name of class.
- there exists a base constructor if you don't make any which is made by compiler. but you can make your own and override it.
- default, parameter, copy, destructor.

# Friend keyword
- a friend class can acces the private and protected members of other classes.

# Encapsulation
- putting data in capsule (container) to hide them direct access.
